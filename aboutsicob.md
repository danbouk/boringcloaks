### These People & Resources Helped Me Make this Blog
* Amanda Visconti's wonderful [primer on Jekyll and GitHub pages](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) got me up and running. And when things got funky, [Moncef Belyamani's blog](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/the-definitive-guide-to-installing-ruby-gems-on-a-mac/) helped.
* Robin Sloan, [media inventor](https://www.robinsloan.com), pointed me to GitHub pages.
* All e-mail updates and subscriptions are powered by [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email).
