Hi, I'm Dan.

This is portrait of me I like, taken by [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/), a while ago---but not so long ago that I can't still pretend to look like this.

![This is a photo of Dan Bouk, with a closely cropped haircut, wire-frame glasses, pale skin, a short beard and mustache, and wearing a brown cordoroy blazer.](/images/bouk_headshot_color.jpg)

My last name, "Bouk," means stomach in Dutch--or so I gather. I do not know what that says about the ancestors who started calling themselves that. Maybe they did not choose it. This I do know: pronunciations *abound*! Here's how my family says it: **BOW (as in what one does before royalty) + K**. But if you end up saying it some other way, I will likely go along. I'm a pluralist!
