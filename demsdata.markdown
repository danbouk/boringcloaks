<h3>What's Up with that Beautiful Book?</h3>
<p>
Democracy's Data is a gorgeous object. That's due in large part to the cover designed by Ben Denzer. As the folks at <i>Fonts in Use</i> <a href= "https://fontsinuse.com/uses/48814/democracy-s-data-by-dan-bouk">explain</a>: "Bold compressed type combined with strategic color make for a memorable typographic image and an effective reading of a long title."
</p>
<p>
After were done ooh-ing and ahh-ing over a cover mockup, Robin Sloan and I set out to turn it into a data visualization. Click <a href="https://www.shroudedincloaksofboringness.com/2022/05/30/housesizeviz.html">here</a> to see the animated result!

<h3>People are saying nice things!</h3>

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/28/books/democracys-data-dan-bouk.html"><b>THE NEW YORK TIMES</b></a>
<p>
<blockquote>Counting the population of America, it seems, is akin to both conducting a symphony and watching a jazz ensemble go to town...<br><br>
The book’s straightforward title undersells its playful contents. “Democracy’s Data” is ruminative and rich; it makes the dull old census a feast for the senses.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/08/19/messy-monumental-task-carrying-out-us-census/"><b>THE WASHINGTON POST</b></a>
<p>
<blockquote>Solid storytelling chops and a friendly tone help Bouk convince readers who might question just how interesting a book about the census can be. Surprise — it can be! In the hands of someone who understands it, the census is a mirror of the country’s ideals, values, flaws and attributes....<br><br>
Bouk uncovers the great paradox about the decennial count: that it is an impossibly large and messy task, but also an awe-inspiring achievement.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/books/g41756117/political-books-elections/"><b>OPRAH DAILY</b></a>
<p>
One of the "10 Must-Read Political Books to Get You Through the 2022 Mid-Term Elections"
<blockquote>A data analyst pores over the pivotal 1940 census and then zooms out, piecing together a revelatory biography of our national ritual, the 10-year accounting of the U.S.’s demographics and a once-in-a decade mosaic of the American people....A vibrant bird's-eye view of who we were and are and--most critically—-who we are becoming in the 21st century.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/nonfiction-explanatory-book-recommendations/672217/"><b>THE ATLANTIC</b></a>

One of "Seven Books that Will Make You Smarter"
<blockquote>This searching, textured inquiry illuminates how much simple population figures can teach us.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://themillions.com/2022/12/a-year-in-reading-maud-newton-3.html"><b>Maud Newton for THE MILLIONS</b></a>

<blockquote>Smart fun for genealogy nerds but also a must-read for anyone interested in the construction and systemic effects of big data.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://nightingaledvs.com/review-dan-bouk-democracys-datathe-hidden-stories-in-the-u-s-census-and-how-to-read-them/"><b>NIGHTINGALE MAGAZINE</b></a>
<p>
<blockquote>The practice of data storytelling often focuses on weaving a narrative by highlighting themes from a dataset. Author Dan Bouk flips this conventional practice on its head by instead telling a powerful story about the data itself.....<br><br>
When we visualize various types of data and use those visualizations to tell stories, we should take a minute to consider the story of how that data came to be in the first place. Rather than uncritically assuming the objectivity of data we work with, this book calls us to strategically assess the frame of the dataset, the way in which the data was gathered, and how we are using it. This book is a crucial read for anyone within the data visualization community who wants to learn how to read the stories behind the data.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dan-bouk/democracys-data/"><b>KIRKUS REVIEWS</b></a>
<p>
<blockquote>A deep dive into the 1940 U.S. census: how it was created, completed, deployed, and even weaponized and what it can teach us about American democracy....<br><br>
A page-turning examination of why we need to understand the census and its wide-ranging effects.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nations-family-secrets-revealed-simson-garfinkel"><b>SIMSON GARFINKEL, Program Scientist at AI2050</b></a>
<p>
<blockquote>The focus of Democracy’s Data is the 1940 US Census, but the story of why the House is locked at 435 members is one of those bonus pieces of context that make this book such a compelling read. This book is filled with details about US history and the history of today’s social problems—a history that today is largely untaught and rarely discussed.<br><br>
These kinds of details, personal reflections and context-filling make Democracy’s Data a pleasure to read, and highly informative.</blockquote>
</p>

<a href="https://www.hypnagogicfun.com/2022/12/"><b>David Potash, President, Wilbur Wright College</b></a>
<p>
<blockquote>Best of all, Bouk captures individual stories in the data. He tracks down relatives, famous people and everyday Americans. Responses in the census give clues to living arrangements, families, racism, sexism, opportunity and challenge. It truly is a data book of America’s lives. His deep appreciation of that, of the information gathered and reported for individual people, gives the entire enterprise a warm and human glow. The census may be numbers, but those numbers represent the valuable and complicated lives of individual people.</blockquote>
</p>

ELLEN ULLMAN, author of <i>Close to the Machine</i>
<p>
<blockquote>Dan Bouk's <i>Democracy's Data</i> is a revelation of the political and cultural forces that led to the 1940 census, and of the philosophical questions that underlie all attempts to classify people. What do we measure? And who has the power to decide?<br><br>
Bouk tells us what is at stake: A battle for the very definition of personhood.</blockquote>
</p>

STEVEN JOHNSON, author of <i>The Ghost Map</i> and <i>Extra Life</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
A tour de force of archival research that reads like a detective story, <i>Democracy's Data</i> reveals an entire secret history behind one of the most underappreciated institutions of modern civic life: the census. Following Dan Bouk through this riveting exploration of what it means to count and be counted has forever changed my understanding of the relationship between information and a democratic society.</blockquote>
</p>

RUHA BENJAMIN, author of <i>Race after Technology</i> and <i>Viral Justice</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
A gifted storyteller, Dan Bouk reveals the political drama rumbling beneath a single census question and he illuminates the stakes erupting from a solitary statistic. It turns out before there was Big Data there was old-fashioned big data, no less political and consequential eighty years ago than it is today. The humanity behind the numbers has always mattered, but <i>Democracy’s Data</i> transformed my black & white understanding into technicolor! Everyone who cares about the plight of our democracy owes it to themself to read this essential book.</blockquote>
</p>

DANAH BOYD, author of <i>It's Complicated</i> and ethnographer of the 2020 Census
<p>
<blockquote>
Who knew stories about government and statistics could be so engrossing?!?! Through intimate, finely-wrought storytelling, Bouk makes an esoteric infrastructure utterly enthralling. <i>Democracy's Data</i> takes you on a captivating journey, peeling back layers to help the reader see what lies behind the numbers.</blockquote>
</p>

MARGO ANDERSON, author of <i>The American Census</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
In 1787, the framers of the Constitution decided that the new federal government would count the population every ten years and use the results to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and Electoral College. 'We, the people,' the constitution asserts in its preamble, are the foundation of the American state. 150 years, 16 censuses later, the 1940 census continued to fulfill that mandate. But it turned out that the census did so much more. Dan Bouk has written an extraordinary book revealing just how prescient the framers were.</blockquote>
</p>

DANIEL RODGERS, author of <i>Age of Fracture</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
With a gift for stories and abundance of acutely probing questions, Dan Bouk brings the making of the U.S. census alive.  In sharply etched detail, he shows how democracy’s data was produced:  from the experts who wrote the census questions, to the politicians who tried to shape and exploit their work, to the millions of doorstep negotiations between census takers and their subjects where ordinary Americans worked to fit themselves into--or resist--its categories.  The politics of numbers has rarely been told as grippingly before.</blockquote>
</p>

ARI BERMAN, author of <i>Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
The U.S. Census is one of the most important yet least understood parts of American democracy and Dan Bouk masterfully tells this story through rich characters, eye-popping data, and deep historical analysis. A must-read for students of history and politics.</blockquote>
</p>

JER THORP, author of <i>Living in Data</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
Page by page, Bouk polishes the seemingly dull census into a scintillating thing, gleaming with stories and sparkling with insight. Democracy's Data is a must-read for anyone who wants to know how data defines our democracy and our lives.</blockquote>

<h3>
The census isn't just a data-collection process; it's a ritual, and a tool, of American democracy. Behind every neat grid of numbers is a collage of messy, human stories...<br>
You just have to know how to read them.
</h3>
<p>
In <i>Democracy's Data</i>, the data historian Dan Bouk examines the 1940 U.S. census, uncovering what those numbers both condense and cleverly abstract: a universe of meaning and uncertainty, of cultural negotiation and political struggle. He introduces us to the men and women employed as census takers, bringing us with them as they go door to door, recording the lives of their neighbors. He takes us into the makeshift halls of the Census Bureau, where hundreds of civil servants, not to mention machines, labored with pencil and paper to divide and conquer the nation's data. And he uses these little points to paint bigger pictures, such as of the ruling hand of white supremacy, the place of queer people in straight systems, and the struggle of ordinary people to be seen by the state as they see themselves.
</p>
<p>
The 1940 census is a crucial entry in American history, a controversial dataset that enabled the creation of New Deal era social programs, but that also, with the advent of World War Two, would be weaponized against many of the citizens whom it was supposed to serve. In our age of quantification, <i>Democracy's Data</i> not only teaches us how to read between the lines but gives us a new perspective on the relationship between representation, identity, and governance today.
