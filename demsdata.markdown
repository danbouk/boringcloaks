"Who knew stories about government and statistics could be so engrossing?!?! Through intimate, finely-wrought storytelling, Bouk makes an esoteric infrastructure utterly enthralling. Democracy's Data takes you on a captivating journey, peeling back layers to help the reader see what lies behind the numbers.”
- danah boyd, partner at Microsoft Research and founder of Data & Society



"In 1787, the framers of the Constitution decided that the new federal government would count the population every ten years and use the results to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and Electoral College. “We, the people,” the constitution asserts in its preamble, are the foundation of the American state. 150 years, 16 censuses later, the 1940 census continued to fulfill that mandate. But it turned out that the census did so much more. Dan Bouk has written an extraordinary book revealing just how prescient the framers were."
- Margo Anderson, author of *The American Census: A Social History*

The census isn't just a data-collection process; it's a ritual, and a tool, of American democracy. Behind every neat grid of numbers is a collage of messy, human stories--you just have to know how to read them.

In *Democracy's Data*, the data historian Dan Bouk examines the 1940 U.S. census, uncovering what those numbers both condense and cleverly abstract: a universe of meaning and uncertainty, of cultural negotiation and political struggle. He introduces us to the men and women employed as census takers, bringing us with them as they go door to door, recording the lives of their neighbors. He takes us into the makeshift halls of the Census Bureau, where hundreds of civil servants, not to mention machines, labored with pencil and paper to divide and conquer the nation's data. And he uses these little points to paint bigger pictures, such as of the ruling hand of white supremacy, the place of queer people in straight systems, and the struggle of ordinary people to be seen by the state as they see themselves.

The 1940 census is a crucial entry in American history, a controversial dataset that enabled the creation of New Deal era social programs, but that also, with the advent of World War Two, would be weaponized against many of the citizens whom it was supposed to serve. In our age of quantification, *Democracy's Data* not only teaches us how to read between the lines but gives us a new perspective on the relationship between representation, identity, and governance today.
